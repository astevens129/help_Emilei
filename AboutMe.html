<div class="aboutme">
<p id="aboutmep">Hi! My name is Emilei, it's pronounced like “Emily”. I moved to the Central Indiana region a year ago and am originally from Peru, Indiana.
I take great pride in being a self-made, self-taught business owner—an achievement fueled by the encouragement of those around me. <br>
Art has always been a passion of mine, and I've long known I wanted to pursue a creative career. Helping people is another core passion, which recently evolved into helping businesses improve their image, communication, and media presence. <br>
In January 2025, after extensive research, I launched my business. <br> More recently, I began studying technology with a focus on web design so I can one day expand my offerings to include tech services.
You can follow my journey and get updates on Facebook.</p>
